    <h1>My Dearest Husband 💌</h1>

    <p>
Hello, my dearest Husband,<br><br>

This is your lovely wife writing a letter to remind you how special and precious you are to me...<br><br>

When I look at you, I see much more than just the love of my life. I always want to see you win, fulfil your dreams. I see how hard you work, how much you carry, and somehow you still show up with your love.<br><br>

Everything happened unexpectedly, we both didn't expect this, and God was really on our side who made it happen. I am really blessed and thankful that someone like you came into my life.<br><br>

<b>THANK YOU...</b><br><br>

Thank you for making me realize and feel that I deserve to be loved, to be happy, and to have someone as amazing as you are. Thank you for loving me and everything about me. Thank you for trusting me and a big thank you for healing a part of me that you had never broken. Thank you for accepting me with all my flaws and clumsiness. Thank you for coming into my life, for loving me unconditionally, and for motivating me everyday. Thank you for waking me up at 5 am every day so that I can't be late in the morning. Thank you for taking a stand for me, thank you for everything that you've done for me.<br><br>

Honestly, these thank yous are not enough to THANK YOU. I need many more words to describe it. You are the first person in my entire life who's done all this for me just to see a smile on my face. I love you every single day and way, and I feel so grateful to have you as my life partner. I had never imagined that I would get such an amazing partner like you, my baby.<br><br>

Whenever you need me, I'm always there for you, no matter what happens, and I will always choose you over anything every single day. I see everything you do for your parents, me, and US, and I appreciate you every single day.<br><br>

You are my person, my happy place, and greatest joy. With you, everything just feels lighter, brighter, and more beautiful. You are my heart, my treasure, my today, my tomorrow, my forever, and my everything. I always want to see you smile and make you laugh like an idiot so that you can forget all your worries.<br><br>

If I could give you one gift, it would probably be the ability to see yourself through my lens; only then would you realize how truly special you are. You light up my life with your every word, laugh, and smile. You are the best thing that's ever been mine and happened to me, and I love you more than words can express.<br><br>

At the end of the day, you are the person I need to talk to, the one I want to tell how my day went, the one I want to share my happiness, sadness, frustration, and success with — and the one with whom I can do back bitch (hehehehe).<br><br>

This thank you never ends bhaiiii.<br><br>

Thank you for coming into my life most unexpectedly, and thank you for taking care of me just like your baby (I really love being your baby). I never felt so loved in my whole life. I don't even know where to end because there's so much to say.<br><br>

I really hope this letter brings a smile to your face, just like you bring light into my day every day. You are like my favorite song, always stuck in my head, comforting and full of warmth. Everything feels magical with you, honestly. I'll always be here for you, just as you have been for me. I am so proud of you in every single way.<br><br>

I love you endlessly. I love you to the moon and Saturn and never come back.<br><br>

Stay tuned for next love diaries by one and only HEER AMIN... oh sorry, HEER JAY PATEL 😉<br><br>

AND YESSS... MY HUSBAND, HURRY HOME. YOUR WIFE IS WAITING. I need a hug — and when I see you, I'm gonna kiss you, okayyyy.<br><br>

Thanking you,<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
Your lovely wife,<br>
<b>Heer Jay Patel</b><br>
XOXO
